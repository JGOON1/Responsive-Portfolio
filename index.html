                    <p class="me">Hello, my name is John, I am currently attending the Penn LPS Coding Bootcamp.
                        I hope gain enough knowledge to become a full stack developer. The reason why I attended
                        a coding bootcamp is because I like learn in a classroom setting.

                    <p class="me"> I am from Lancaster, Pennsylvania and now currently living in Philadelphia.
                        Something things that I like to do is hiking, biking, and playing volleyball.
                        I graduated from Temple University with a Bachelors in Geology.

                    <br>
                    <p class="me">I think I was able to have a good understanding of HTML and CSS. Things definetly just
                        clicked for me while working on this assignment. I think the challenging part was the css
                        and have to position everything the right way. But I manage to get picture what would affect where
                        after doing this assignment.
